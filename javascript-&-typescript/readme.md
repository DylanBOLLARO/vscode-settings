# Visual Studio Code Settings

Installing a development environment for Javascript & Typescript for Visual Studio Code

## Installation

Retrieve the profile file to import into vscode:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DylanBOLLARO/vscode-settings/refs/heads/main/javascript-&-typescript/JS_TS.code-profile
```

On vscode, go to settings then profiles. Select the button to import a profile and select the downloaded file then create the profile.

Wait for all extensions to be downloaded, then activate the JS_TS profile, restart vscode and have fun!
